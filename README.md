## Start the Cloudflare Tunnel 

This is required to expose your local LangGraph API (running on `localhost:8123`) to the public internet via a secure **HTTPS endpoint**, which the frontend UI (hosted on Vercel) can access without CORS issues.
Cloudflare provides a temporary HTTPS URL without a public IP or domain setup.

```
nohup cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8123 > tunnel.log 2>&1 &
```
Go to `tunnel.log` and note the https URL generated by Cloudflare. It looks something like this 
https://XXXXXXX.trycloudflare.com


## Use the Maxit Chatbot 

### Start the Chatbot  

We use Agent vercel Chabtot to connect to our Langgraph Agent end point. 

1. Navigate to [Agent Vercel Chatbot](https://agentchat.vercel.app/) 
2. Complete the set-up 
    - Deployment URL: Provide the https URL generated by Cloudflare 
    - Assistant / Graph ID: 'agent'
